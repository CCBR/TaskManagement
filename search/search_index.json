Create Labels \u00b6 Clone the repo locally and use gh cli to create labels using the create_priority_labels.sh script to do this automatically. If gh cli is not already installed then, follow these instructions. % git clone https://github.com/CCBR/vlog.git % cd vlog % curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCBR/TaskManagement/main/scripts/create_priority_labels.sh curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCBR/TaskManagement/main/scripts/create_priority_labels.sh % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed 100 499 100 499 0 0 1832 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 1868 % bash ./create_priority_labels.sh gh is in PATH \u2713 Label \"LowPriority\" created in CCBR/vlog \u2713 Label \"MediumPriority\" created in CCBR/vlog \u2713 Label \"HighPriority\" created in CCBR/vlog % rm -f ./create_priority_labels.sh Check in the browser ( https://github.com/ORGNAME/REPONAME/labels ) if the labels are created correctly.

Create Issues \u00b6 There are many ways of creating new tasks (called as issues in GH). It is best to go to the issues page of the repo and click New Issue Enter title, body, assign yourself, select label, milestone and then select click Projects to select the Project board that was just created. NOTE: Multiple labels or assignees can be selected. NOTE: Body of the issue supports Markdown. Screenshots can also be copy-pasted and GH handles storing image files automatically. NOTE: An issue can be assigned to multiple \"Projects\". Then, click \"Submit New Issue\". Now that the issue has been created \"Status\" under appropriate project can be set to .. say \"BackLog\" Now you have created a new task and added it to the Backlog swimlane on your Kanban. It is also visible on List View NOTE: It is recommended to: Rename the Views as \"List\" and \"Kanban\". Add new columns (Labels, Milestone, and Repository) to the \"List\" view and save the changes. Group by \"Milestone\" for better viewing and save again. Issues can also be created from \"List\" and \"Kanban\" view directly, but they need to be assigned to the appropriate repo accordingly.","title":"HowTo"},{"location":"#_1","text":"Some best practices to use GitHub Projects to track daily tasks.","title":""},{"location":"#create-repo","text":"It is best to create a new repo first, preferrably not on your personal account but on your org account.
